# san_francisco_housing_ipynb
## Background

Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. As an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

My approach is to use my data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

## What You're Creating

A Jupyter notebook that contains analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.

## Software Used
The following python modules are used in the application. Remember to install these packages via Terminal for MacOS/Linux or GitBash for windows clients.

pandas - pandas is used to interact with data packages, plot data frames, create new dataframes, describe abailable data, and helps traders and fintech proffesionals organize financial data to perform advanced decisionmaking.

pathlib - Allows the user to specify the path to a data frame / any data in a csv file.

hvplot.pandas

If hvplot and pandas are both installed, then we can use the pandas.options.plotting.backend to control the output of pd.DataFrame.plot and pd.Series.plot. This notebook is meant to recreate the pandas visualization docs.
